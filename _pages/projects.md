    <p><H4 style="margin-top: 0em;" >Machine Learning (ML) & eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for Arctic Sea Ice</H4></p>
    <p> Machine learning (ML) models for sea ice in the Arctic have fewer complexities and are more computationally efficient than traditional physics-based models. 
      This work uses remote sensing data and model output from CMIP6 to build ML models that make <i> skillful </i>, predictions of sea ice properties (sea-ice motion, sea-ice extent, etc.) in the Arctic on various time scales (daily, seasonal, interannual). 
      I also implement eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to understand the predictions made by the ML models and gain valuable insight into the drivers of variability for sea ice properties.

  <p> Machine learning is a useful tool to predict and understand sea-ice motion in the Arctic.
    <b>Predictability:</b> I build ML models to make one-day predictions of Arctic sea-ice motion for operational forecasting.
    <b>Understanding:</b> In a changing Arctic, sea ice is becoming more responsive to wind forcing. Historically, wind velocity has been shown to explain 70% of the variability in sea-ice velocity. However, the response of sea-ice to the dynamic mechanisms that drive its motion is changing as it melts. I use XAI techniques to understand the nuances in this changing relationship between wind and ice motion.  </p>

    <p><H4>Modeling Upper Ocean Salinity Response to Atmospheric Rivers</H4></p>
    <p> Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are responsible for a large fraction of the precipitation in the California Current System. 
      Rainfall on the ocean can generate freshwater lenses (i.e. a buoyant layer of fresh water at the surface) that impact ocean stratification and inhibit exchanges between the surface and the mixed layer.
      This work employed a combination of observations and a dynamical model (the MITgcm) to understand the surface salinity response to atmospheric river precipitation on both event and seasonal timescales. 
      Seasonally, greater precipitation over the rainy season is linked to a larger decrease in salinity over time. 
      On event timescales, AR precipitation events commonly produce a surface salinity response that is detectable by ocean instruments.</p>
