I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Universit&eacute Catholique de Louvain in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.


#### Current Reserarch
I use machine learning to study sea ice in the Arctic.  I am currently applying machine learning techniques to predict and understand rapid sea ice loss as a part of the <a href="https://arcticwatch-erc.github.io" target = "_blank">ArcticWATCH</a> project.  I am also using explainable AI (XAI) to understand changes in the drivers of variability of sea ice, with particular focus evolution of the relationship between wind speed and ice speed as Arctic ice diminishes in a warming climate.
